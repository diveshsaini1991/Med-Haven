## üì¶ Dockerized Setup

MedHaven is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, enabling consistent development and deployment environments.

### üê≥ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed

---

### üîß Running the Project with Docker

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diveshsaini1991/Med-Haven.git
cd Med-Haven
```

**Start all services using Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command builds and runs:

- MongoDB
- Backend API (Node.js + Express)
- Frontend (React)
- Admin Dashboard
- Doctor Dashboard

**üåê Access Locally**

| Service          | URL                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend (User)  | [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) |
| Admin Dashboard  | [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) |
| Doctor Dashboard | [http://localhost:5175](http://localhost:5175) |
| Backend API      | [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) |
| MongoDB          | Runs on port `27017`                           |

**‚öôÔ∏è Environments & Configuration**

- Each service has its own Docker image.

- Environment variables for the backend are defined inside docker-compose.yml .

- Volumes are used to persist MongoDB data and sync local code for development.


**üõë Stopping All Services**

```bash
docker-compose down
```
